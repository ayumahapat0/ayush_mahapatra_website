    Here is a little bit about me!
</p>

<h2>
    Education
</h2>

<p>
    Currently, I am pursuing a Masters of Science in Artificial Intelligence, with a Machine Learning concentration, at Northeastern University.
    During December 2024, I obtained a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a Minor in Data Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

<h2>
   My Passion for Machine Learning Applications
</h2>

<p>
    My passion in lies in Machine Learning and its application into Science and Education. I discoverd my passion for Machine Learning applications when 
    I was a part of the Informatics Skunkworks club. The club allows students to gain research the applications of Data Informatics, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning in different
    scienctic fields. Our research project under Dr. Ben Afflerbach was about Generative Machine Learning models. During my time, we analyzed a Crystal Diffusion Variational Auto Encoder that
    generates over 10,000 new materials with the goal of optimizing bandgap to improve electric conductivity. From this experience, I gained a new understand of just how machine learning can be leveraged into applications for other fields.
    Here at Northeastern, I want to further explore these Machine Learning applications and discover whether I want to apply them in the field of Science, Education, Healtcare, or a combination of them all!

<h2>
   Industry Experience
</h2>

<p>
    During the summer of 2024, I was a Backend Software Engineering Intern in Staples' Digital Solutions division, working with the Financial Services team as a Software Engineering Intern. During this internship, I developed
    a Spring Boot Microservice that utilized a Oauth2.0 secured RESTful API to activate or cancel warranty for all future Apple, HP, and Brother Products that
    Staples sells. My project went into production!

    During the summer of 2025, I was a software engineer intern at Staples, under the same team and manager. I developed JUnit tests
    for Staples Billing Service API, the service that handles Staple's customer invoice generation. Even though I had less coding responbilities,
    the tests I was creating was responsible for critical software that Staples Financial Services team will rely on.

    From these experiences, I learned about the Industry-level Software Development cycle, how to prepare presentations and demos, and how to truly work and collaborate with people with different 
    backgrounds and technological skills. These opportunities serve as the foundation of my career moving forward! 
</p>

<p>
    I am actively looking for an Entry Level Software Engineering job, Software Engineering Internship, or Software Engineering Co-Op, specifically in Data Science and Machine Learning!
